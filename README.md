# Photo-Duplicate-Detector
This program was made so i can scan my 2TB SSD and see if there are any duplicate photos. This is a work in progress.
I made this program to solve a problem I have as a photographer and videographer with thousands of photos and hundreds of videos stored manny times on a hard drive. 
I made this to help cleanup space on my 2TB SSD so i wouldent have to buy another one because of wasted space.
## main.py
This is the first version that I cam up with. 
## main_v2.py
This is the second version that has slight improvements from the first but is mainly just a checkpoint so I can test and add quality of life things.
## store.json
This file is where the duplicates are listed for now so the user can see what files have dupliates and where they are along with information like name, path, size(Mb), and MD5 hash value.
